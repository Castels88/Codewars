// Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc.,
// depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers
// as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
// Example [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134

let min = (list) => Math.min(...list)

let max = (list) => Math.max(...list)
